TOWER OF HANOI!
- Idea is to get all discs from the first pin (A)
  to either second (B) or third (C) pin in such 
  fashion, that starting from bottom 
  discs are ordered from widest to smallest.

- You can only move 1 disc at a time. You
  can only move the topmost disc from each pin.

- You can never even temporarily place a bigger 
  disc on top of a smaller disc. Illegal moves
  are prevented.

HOW IT WORKS:
- After running the program, enter the desired
  amount of discs (1-12) and hit ENTER/RETURN.

- You can make moves by either clicking 1 of the
  6 push buttons OR by entering your command 
  (for example "AB" or "cA") and hitting
  ENTER/RETURN.

- If 1-12 discs does not satisfy the "n"-requirement,
  you can alter the maximum accepted value by going
  to mainwindow.hh and altering "const int MAX_DISKS"
  in the private section.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES in hopes of extra points:
- Disks change color, when shifted to another
  peg. Inside program code I call them pins,
  please bear with me.

- At any given time you're able to restart the
  game without restarting the program. Even after
  finishing a game.

- The number of moves made & difference to
  minimum required moves is displayed.

- Has 2 ways of moving the disks - pushbuttons
  and text command.
